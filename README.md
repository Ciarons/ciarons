I build Python tools that solve real business problems. Currently working on automating inventory management workflows with Azure AI.

## What I'm building

**Asset Management Tool** — Inventory management system with automated pricing and AI image validation
- Automated product data enrichment and pricing calculations
- Azure Computer Vision integration for image quality control
- Batch processing workflows for large inventories
- Built with Python, CustomTkinter, Azure services

## Recent work

- Integrated Azure AI Vision for automated image validation
- Built dynamic search with multiple query strategies and automatic fallback
- Created pricing models that properly handle complex fee structures
- Designed batch processing for high-volume operations

Working with Azure Cognitive Services to improve image validation accuracy and reduce manual QA time.
